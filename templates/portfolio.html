                        Firebase for its backend and Google App Engine for hosting. Firebase works
                        by storing an encrypted seed generated by the client. After authentication,
                        it is retrieved and is used to rebuild the Monero Private Key. This is used

                        Android app was also built leveraging the same back-end.

                        retrieved via CORS request to Nodes that have
                        implemented a compatible REST API. Additionally, the app offers a "node
